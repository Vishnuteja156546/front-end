    <!-- Description Section -->
    <div class="description-container">
        <div class="description">
            <h3>1. Python Programming</h3>
            <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Python is the primary programming language used in Data Science. Mastering Python will allow you to handle data, automate tasks, and implement machine learning models.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <h3>2. Data Analysis and Visualization</h3>
            <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> A large part of a data scientist’s job involves exploring and analyzing data to extract meaningful insights. Proficiency in Pandas, Numpy, and visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn will enable you to perform these tasks effectively.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <h3>3. Machine Learning</h3>
            <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Machine learning is at the core of predictive modeling, which is essential for making data-driven decisions. Understanding and applying algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and SVMs is crucial for building models that can predict outcomes based on data.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <h3>4. Deep Learning</h3>
            <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Deep Learning, which involves neural networks, is used in advanced areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and other complex tasks. Knowledge in this area will make you proficient in cutting-edge data science applications.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <h3>5. Unsupervised Learning and Clustering</h3>
            <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Not all data is labeled or structured. Techniques like clustering help in discovering hidden patterns in data, which is valuable in areas like customer segmentation and anomaly detection.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <h3>6. Time Series Analysis</h3>
            <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Many real-world data science problems involve time-series data (e.g., stock prices, weather data). Being able to analyze and predict trends in time series data is a valuable skill.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <h3>7. Model Evaluation and Tuning</h3>
            <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Building models is just one part of the job. Evaluating their performance and tuning them to improve accuracy are critical skills that ensure your models are reliable and effective.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <h3>8. Advanced Topics and Future Learning</h3>
            <p><strong>Relevance:</strong> As a data scientist, continuous learning is essential. Advanced topics like Reinforcement Learning or Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) open up even more possibilities and keep you updated with industry trends.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="description" style="grid-column: span 2;">
            <h3>Job Readiness</h3>
            <p>After completing this study plan, you’ll be equipped with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technical Skills:</strong> In Python, data manipulation, machine learning, and deep learning.</li>
                <li><strong>Analytical Skills:</strong> For data exploration, visualization, and modeling.</li>
                <li><strong>Practical Experience:</strong> Through hands-on projects and exercises.</li>
                <li><strong>Portfolio:</strong> To showcase your work to potential employers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Together, these will prepare you to pursue a career in data science, and with continued learning and experience, you can advance to more specialized or higher-paying roles within the field.</p>
